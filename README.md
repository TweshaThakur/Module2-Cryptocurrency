Hardcoin Cryptocurrency - Blockchain Project
This project implements a decentralized cryptocurrency called Hardcoin using Python and Flask. The system is based on blockchain technology, featuring proof-of-work consensus, transaction management, and node communication. The project also includes functionality for decentralizing the blockchain network by connecting multiple nodes and ensuring consensus.

Features
Blockchain Creation: Implements a blockchain with proof-of-work consensus, allowing for secure and decentralized data storage.
Transaction Management: Enables peer-to-peer transactions within the blockchain, recording sender, receiver, and amount.
Decentralized Network: Supports connecting multiple nodes, ensuring consensus through the longest valid chain rule.
Flask Web API: Provides endpoints for mining blocks, adding transactions, connecting nodes, and validating the blockchain.
